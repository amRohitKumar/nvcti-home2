We will be having Lathe machine which can do a number of operations such thread generation, grooving, cutting etc. We will be having drilling machine, welding and grinders also. There will be analytical balance and general weighing machine, chop saw machine in addition to mechanical tool set. For generation of 3D models and parts, 3D scanners and printers will be used depending on the complexities of shapes. We have also proposed a Rapid prototyping machine which is similar to a 3D printer with additive manufacturing technology. ",

Although many of the research groups are working on this field; limitation of prototype fabrication is a severe limitation to access their practical application. Hence a prototype battery fabrication unit in the form of coin or Pouch cell will help the students to have hand on experience on the techniques used for battery fabrication and their testing which enable them to test their materials for efficiency. This will help for in-house production of battery prototype which could be scale up for further development based on their capacity and integration with solar cells. ",
